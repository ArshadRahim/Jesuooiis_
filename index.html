  <h2> WHAT DOES A BJDC TOKEN GET YOU ? </h2>
  <p class="first-paragraph">A BJDC token gives you access to an exclusive club.</p>
<p>
    We plan to buy a piece of land for the BJDC in 
    Hawaii with the proceeds of this sale after 100% of the tokens are sold. Think of it like our private
    Garden of Eden. All BJDC token holders will get to visit it, socialize on it, claim it, and decide what 
    we do with it. 
    We will build a Decentralized Autonomous Organization for BJDC holders after 25% of BJDCs are
    sold. Each BJCD you own is a membership token. We have some astounding and some wacky plans - but the DAO will have to approve them as we move forward. 
    BJDC holders will set the course and take over the steering as soon as the DAO is set upâ€¦
